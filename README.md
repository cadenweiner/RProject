# RProject



Version 1: Inheritance only implementation of food and drinks and employee. This part will likely go away once I implement the webapp since I will implement the inheritance through the database structure. 
Version 1 will be done in a separate C++ project

Version 2: Begin webapp/Start Testing Iteration 1: WebApp Phase 1 Iteration 2: WebApp Phase 2 Iteration 3: WebApp Phase 3 Version 3: Implement Simultion using random number generators. Version 4: Improve Simulation by using Machine Learning

Info: Database: Will be using the SQLAlchemy Lite DataBase Machine Learning: Plotly/Dash libraries (Non Definite, need to do more research about the available libraries) CSS: Design and Style Model View Controller interface Flask Webapp

More will be added as I come up with new ideas

I will be designing an application that uses inheritance to create an interface for observing the analytics of a restaurant.

The Manager will be able to view the price for each item and the profit that can be made. Manager can set a

There will be drink items such as coffee and different food items.

I may end up designing this as a web application and have customers that can place orders. A Customer would be able to place many orders and they are sent to the Manager to confirm. A Customer should only be able to order between 5 AM and 9 PM. There will be an active orders page for the employer and they can fufil orders. A Customer can make an account or can place an order without logging in. A Customer can view the menu. A Manager can view the menu and it will also display the cost to prepare the ingredient and the profit gained in the transaction. There will be a record of transactions that will be displayed for the manager. There will also be a daily, and monthly report feature.

Possible idea to implement: This could be done in our tests Simulate a day of orders with automated customers coming in and ordering random items. Make them behave similair to what would be expected of a regular customer. Maybe experiment with AI and have it predict the optimal times of day to do buisness. Have a population size n which indicates the population of the area. Each person could have a chance of going to the restaraunt or not. Certain days will have more people come
